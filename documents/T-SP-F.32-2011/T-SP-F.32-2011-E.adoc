== Note from TSB

. By TSB Circular 179 of 16 October 1995, TSB announced the approval of ITU-T
Recommendation F.32 (10/1995) (previously F.96), in accordance with Resolution 1, Section 8 of
the WTSC (Helsinki, 1993), and by TSB Circular 104 of 23 March 1998, it announced the approval
of ITU-T Recommendation F.1 (03/1998): “Operational provisions for the international public
telegram service”, the text of which was revised by ITU-T Study Group 2.

--
Accordingly, TSB prepared a _List of Telegram Destination Indicators_ allocated to
countries/geographical areas or networks (first two letters) and assigned to telegraph offices of
destination (third and fourth letters), in accordance with ITU-T Recommendation F.32 (10/1995).
This List also contains special origin indicators and indicators to be used in the preamble line of
Government telegrams to designate international organizations, pursuant to paragraph A218 of
ITU-T Recommendation F.1 (03/1998).
--

. The new List, published as an Annex to ITU Operational Bulletin No. 980 of 15 May 2011,
replaces that published in ITU Operational Bulletin No. 879 of 1 March 2007. The countries or
geographical areas for which information regarding the cessation of the telegram service has been
published in the ITU Operational Bulletin (No.) are appended to this List.

In addition, administrations/ROAs are reminded that the List of Telex Network Identification
Codes (TNIC) referred to in paragraph 7.3 of ITU-T Recommendation F.32 (10/1995) is published
separately as an Annex to the ITU Operational Bulletin and is regularly updated by amendments.

One of the main objectives of ITU-T Recommendation F.32 (10/1995) is to encourage
administrations/ROAs to reduce the number of destination indicators allocated to their telegram
networks. In recent years, many administrations/ROAs have adopted a single destination
indicator (--XX) for all destinations, or have assigned only a very limited number of destination
indicators to their networks. TSB wishes to draw the particular attention of administrations/ROAs to
Section 6 of ITU-T Recommendation F.32 (10/1995), which states that “The office codes (i.e., the
third and fourth letters in a destination indicator) allocated for each network code should be kept to
a minimum number in each network” and that “Where the destination network is capable of
carrying out the national routing without an office code (e.g. by analysing the address part of the
telegram, as well as the pilot line), a single office code (XX) is preferred.”
--

. In the interests of keeping the List up-to-date, administrations/ROAs are requested to check
the accuracy of the information it contains and to inform TSB as soon as possible of any changes
that should be made for its updating (Fax: *+41 22 730 5853*, or E-mail: *mailto:tsbtson@itu.int[]*). Changes
will be published in the subsequent ITU Operational Bulletin as Amendments to the List.

. Furthermore, the information contained in this Annex to ITU Operational Bulletin No. 980 is
also available on the ITU website
link:https://www.itu.int/itu-t/bulletin/annex.html[www.itu.int/itu-t/bulletin/annex.html].

. The designations used and the information presented in the List do not imply the expression
of any opinion whatsoever on the part of ITU concerning the legal status of any country or
geographical area, or of its authorities.
