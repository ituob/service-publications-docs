notes: 'Global numbers used for the European eCall service Following the agreement
  reached at the meeting of ITU-T Study Group 2, which is the leading study group
  on numbering, naming, addressing, identification and routing, it is noted that:
  “Several number ranges under non geographic country codes are used for eCall, the
  pan European emergency system for vehicles. These numbers have been assigned by
  the ITU and they have been available for use in association with eCall service.
  These numbers are used as calling party numbers when the device automatically calls
  the emergency number in the event of an accident. They generally use 15 digit formats.
  Since 31 March 2018, all new type cars sold in Europe must have eCall capability.
  In order for the eCall system to operate properly and for the emergency services
  (e.g. call centres and intervention teams) to dial back the phone numbers used by
  the eCall systems, it is crucial that the eCall ranges be opened in all networks
  and that the CLI (Calling Line Identification) for these calls is passed between
  operators in a correct and diallable format according to the relevant ITU recommendations.
  Given the criticality of the service, we want to alert the assignees and all stakeholders
  on the need for these numbers to be opened and routed on public networks and in
  particular those in Europe. The ECC recommendation (17)04 “Numbering for eCall”
  (https://www.ecodocdb.dk/document/1019) also provides more information on numbering
  options for eCall.” The ITU has been notified of the following ranges as being used
  for eCall: 883 130, 882 39, 882 37, 883 390 and 882 47. Other operators using global
  resources for eCall may also inform the ITU to request similar publications. Contacts:
