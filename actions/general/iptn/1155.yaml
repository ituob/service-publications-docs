notes: Global numbers used for the European eCall service. From 31 March 2018, all
  new type cars sold in Europe must have eCall capability. For the emergency services
  to dial back the phone numbers, it is crucial that the eCall ranges be opened in
  all networks and that the CLI is passed correctly.
