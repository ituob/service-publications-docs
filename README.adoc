== General

This repository contains ITU Operational Bulletin (OB) Service Publications
documents. These documents are published by the ITU and provide important
operational information for telecommunication services.

The documents are organized in folders with a numbering scheme corresponding to
the OB issue number, followed by the document identifier (e.g., `1109-Q.708B`,
`1161-E.118`).


== Structure

`metanorma.yml`::
The site configuration for the Metanorma site. This file defines the site's
title, description, and the documents that are published.

Various document directories (e.g. `1109-Q.708B`, `1161-E.118`)::
Source documents for different Service Publications, organized by their
publication identifier.

`_site/`::
(automatically generated after processing) Published documents.


== Working with the documents

The Service Publications documents are available in multiple languages, typically:

* English (E)
* French (F)
* Spanish (S)
* Arabic (A)
* Chinese (C)
* Russian (R)

The documents follow a naming convention of `T-SP-{identifier}-{year}-{language}.adoc`.

[example]
`T-SP-Q.708B-2016-E.adoc` is the English version of the Q.708B Service
Publication from 2016.


== Building the site

=== Local installs

If you use a locally installed Metanorma, for the first time, run:

[source,sh]
----
metanorma site generate --agree-to-terms
----

NOTE: This is to install fonts needed by ITU.

Subsequently, just run:

[source,sh]
----
metanorma site generate
----

NOTE: See https://www.metanorma.org/install/usage/ for details.


=== Docker

If you don't want to deal with local dependencies, use the docker
version by:

[source,sh]
----
docker run \
  -v "$(pwd)":/metanorma \
  -v "${HOME}/.fontist/fonts":/config/fonts \
  -w /metanorma \
  metanorma/metanorma \
  metanorma site generate --agree-to-terms
----

NOTE: See https://www.metanorma.org/install/docker/ for details.


== Building a single document

=== Local installs

If you use a locally installed Metanorma, for the first time, run:

[source,sh]
----
metanorma {filename} --agree-to-terms
# e.g., metanorma 1109-Q.708B/T-SP-Q.708B-2016-E.adoc --agree-to-terms
----

NOTE: This is to install fonts needed by ITU.

Subsequently, just run:

[source,sh]
----
metanorma {filename}
# e.g., metanorma 1109-Q.708B/T-SP-Q.708B-2016-E.adoc
----

NOTE: See https://www.metanorma.org/install/usage/ for details.

=== Development installs

If you are using the development version of Metanorma, the `bundle` command is
required for creating an isolated context for the Metanorma development
environment.

A `Gemfile` is provided in the repository to set the context.

These steps are necessary to ensure that the correct version of Metanorma is
used to build the documents.

. Prior to any `metanorma` command, please run `bundle install` to
install the dependencies. This is a one-time operation.

. Run `bundle update` (once in a while) to update the dependencies to the latest
versions.

. Please prefix all commands to `metanorma` with `bundle exec`. i.e., use `bundle exec metanorma` instead of `metanorma`.

[example]
====
To build a document using a development install, run `bundle exec metanorma
1109-Q.708B/T-SP-Q.708B-2016-E.adoc`.
====


=== Docker

If you don't want to deal with local dependencies, use the docker
version by:

[source,sh]
----
docker run \
  -v "$(pwd)":/metanorma \
  -v "${HOME}/.fontist/fonts":/config/fonts \
  -w /metanorma \
  metanorma/metanorma \
  metanorma {filename} --agree-to-terms
# e.g., metanorma 1109-Q.708B/T-SP-Q.708B-2016-E.adoc --agree-to-terms
----

NOTE: The `--agree-to-terms` flag is needed if the font cache
(`"${HOME}/.fontist/fonts"`) is not present.

NOTE: See https://www.metanorma.org/install/docker/ for details.
