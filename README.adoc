== General

This repository contains ITU Operational Bulletin (OB) Service Publications
documents. These documents are published by the ITU and provide important
operational information for telecommunication services.


== Structure

`metanorma.yml`::
The site configuration for the Metanorma site. This file defines the site's
title, description, and the documents that are published.

`datasets.yml`::
This file describes all validated datasets stored in this repository.

`datasets/`::
This directory contains the datasets used in the ITU Service Publications
documents.
The datasets are organized in folders with a numbering scheme corresponding to
the OB issue number, followed by the document identifier
+
[example]
====
The dataset `1154-RR.25.1` was created at OB Issue 1154 as an Annex and is
defined by the ITU standard "RR.25.1"

`1109-Q.708B`, `1161-E.118` are other examples.
====

`documents/`::
This directory contains the source documents for the ITU Service Publications.
Each document is organized in its own directory, named after the document
identifier
+
[example]
====
T-SP-X.121B-2011

`_site/`::
(automatically generated after processing) Published documents.


== Working with documents

The Service Publications documents are available in multiple languages, typically:

* English (E)
* French (F)
* Spanish (S)
* Arabic (A)
* Chinese (C)
* Russian (R)

The documents follow a naming convention of `T-SP-{identifier}-{year}-{language}.adoc`.

[example]
`T-SP-Q.708B-2016-E.adoc` is the English version of the Q.708B Service
Publication from 2016.



== ITU OB datasets

=== General

The ITU Operational Bulletin datasets are stored in the `datasets/` directory.

These datasets are used to populate the content of the ITU Service Publications
documents.

=== Structure

Each dataset in the `datasets/` directory follows a specific structure:

`datasets/{dataset-dir}/metadata.yaml`::
A metadata file that conforms to the root `datasets/schema-metadata.yaml` schema. This file contains metadata about the dataset.

`datasets/{dataset-dir}/data.yaml` or `datasets/{dataset-dir}/data/*.yaml`::
One or more YAML files containing the actual data entries for the dataset.
These files must conform to the schema defined in
`datasets/{dataset-dir}/schema-data.yaml`.

`datasets/{dataset-dir}/schema-data.yaml`::
A YAML schema file that defines the structure and validation rules for the data files in this dataset.


.Structure of the 977-X.121B dataset
[example]
====
This dataset keeps all data instances within a single file `data.yaml`.

=== Metadata file

Each dataset must have a `metadata.yaml` file that contains metadata about the
dataset. This file must conform to the schema defined in
`datasets/schema-metadata.yaml`.

Specifically, the metadata file must include the following properties:

`title`:: The title of the dataset. The title is given as an object that
contains the minimum languages of `en:`, `fr:` and `es:`. Metanorma site.

`locale`:: Defined multilingual strings use in the dataset for data
presentation. This is an optional array.
+
Each item in the array has the following properties:
`key`::: A user-defined key of the locale string.
`en/fr/es/ar/zh/ru`::: The locale string in the respective language. At least `en:`,
`fr:` and `es:` are required.

Each metadata file must start with this line:

[source,yaml]
----
# yaml-language-server: $schema=../schema-metadata.yaml
---
# data ...
----

=== Data file

Each dataset must have a `data.yaml` file or a `data/` directory containing
multiple YAML files. These files must conform to the schema defined in
`datasets/{dataset-dir}/schema-data.yaml`.

Each data file (whether a collection or a single file) must start either line:

.Single data file
[source,yaml]
----
# yaml-language-server: $schema=schema-data.yaml
----

.Split data files
[source,yaml]
----
# yaml-language-server: $schema=../schema-data.yaml
----

=== Data schema file

Each dataset must have a `schema-data.yaml` file that defines the structure and
validation rules for the data files in this dataset.

The data schema file is a YAML Schema file.

The data schema file must start with this line:

[source,yaml]
----
# yaml-language-server: $schema=http://json-schema.org/draft-07/schema#
----

The data schema file must at least have the following properties:

`$schema`:: The schema version. This must be set to `http://json-schema.org/draft-07/schema#`.
`$id`:: The unique identifier for the schema. This should be a URL that
identifies the schema.
`title`:: The title of the schema. This should be a human-readable title
for the schema.
`description`:: A human-readable description of the schema.


== ITU OB Service Publications documents

=== General

The Service Publication documents provide the latest dataset definitions (called
the "position") as defined in ongoing issues of the ITU Operational Bulletin.

Each of them are Metanorma documents located in the `documents/` directory.
A document may use one or more datasets to populate its content.

Each document directory typically represents a specific ITU publication and
contains:

`T-SP-{identifier}-{year}-{language}.adoc`::
The main document file in Metanorma AsciiDoc format.

`_table.liquid` or other template files::
Optional template files used for document generation since the target
documents are multilingual.

Documents may reference datasets through includes or variables. A single
document may use one or more datasets to populate its content.

== Dataset validation

=== General

The repository includes a Ruby gem called `ituob` that provides tools for working
with ITU Operational Bulletin service publications, including YAML schema
validation.

=== Installation

The gem is included in the project's Gemfile. To use it, simply run:

[source,sh]
----
bundle install
----

=== Usage

The `ituob` gem provides a command-line interface for validating YAML files
against their schemas.

==== Dataset validation

To validate datasets, use the `dataset validate` command:

[source,sh]
----
bundle exec ituob dataset validate
----

This command validates all datasets in the repository according to their schema definitions.

==== Command options

The following options are available for the schema validation command:

* `--file`, `-f`: Validate a specific file
* `--directory`, `-d`: Validate files in a directory
* `--recursive`, `-r`: Recursively validate files in subdirectories
* `--verbose`, `-v`: Show verbose output



== Building the site

=== Local installs

If you use a locally installed Metanorma, for the first time, run:

[source,sh]
----
metanorma site generate --agree-to-terms
----

NOTE: This is to install fonts needed by ITU.

Subsequently, just run:

[source,sh]
----
metanorma site generate
----

NOTE: See https://www.metanorma.org/install/usage/ for details.


=== Docker

If you don't want to deal with local dependencies, use the docker
version by:

[source,sh]
----
docker run \
  -v "$(pwd)":/metanorma \
  -v "${HOME}/.fontist/fonts":/config/fonts \
  -w /metanorma \
  metanorma/metanorma \
  metanorma site generate --agree-to-terms
----

NOTE: See https://www.metanorma.org/install/docker/ for details.


== Building a single document

=== Local installs

If you use a locally installed Metanorma, for the first time, run:

[source,sh]
----
metanorma {filename} --agree-to-terms
# e.g., metanorma 1109-Q.708B/T-SP-Q.708B-2016-E.adoc --agree-to-terms
----

NOTE: This is to install fonts needed by ITU.

Subsequently, just run:

[source,sh]
----
metanorma {filename}
# e.g., metanorma 1109-Q.708B/T-SP-Q.708B-2016-E.adoc
----

NOTE: See https://www.metanorma.org/install/usage/ for details.


=== Development installs

If you are using the development version of Metanorma, the `bundle` command is
required for creating an isolated context for the Metanorma development
environment.

A `Gemfile` is provided in the repository to set the context.

These steps are necessary to ensure that the correct version of Metanorma is
used to build the documents.

. Prior to any `metanorma` command, please run `bundle install` to
install the dependencies. This is a one-time operation.

. Run `bundle update` (once in a while) to update the dependencies to the latest
versions.

. Please prefix all commands to `metanorma` with `bundle exec`. i.e., use `bundle exec metanorma` instead of `metanorma`.

[example]
====
To build a document using a development install, run `bundle exec metanorma
1109-Q.708B/T-SP-Q.708B-2016-E.adoc`.
====


=== Docker

If you don't want to deal with local dependencies, use the docker
version by:

[source,sh]
----
docker run \
  -v "$(pwd)":/metanorma \
  -v "${HOME}/.fontist/fonts":/config/fonts \
  -w /metanorma \
  metanorma/metanorma \
  metanorma {filename} --agree-to-terms
# e.g., metanorma 1109-Q.708B/T-SP-Q.708B-2016-E.adoc --agree-to-terms
----

NOTE: The `--agree-to-terms` flag is needed if the font cache
(`"${HOME}/.fontist/fonts"`) is not present.

NOTE: See https://www.metanorma.org/install/docker/ for details.
