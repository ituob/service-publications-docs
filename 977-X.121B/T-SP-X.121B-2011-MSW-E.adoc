== Note from TSB

[class=steps]
. ITU-T Recommendation X.121 stipulates that the assignment of Data Country Codes (DCC) is administered by ITU. Assignment of network digits to create Data Network Identification Codes (DNIC) will be made by each administration. ITU/TSB is to be notified of any new assignments, re-allocations or removals of network digits by completing the notification form shown in the last page of this list.

. In accordance with ITU-T Recommendation X.121, details concerning the assignment of Data Network Identification Codes (DNIC) have been individually published in the ITU Operational Bulletin and then collected in a "List of Data Network Identification Codes (DNIC)".

. This year's list replaces the previous one published in the Annex to ITU Operational Bulletin No. 876 of 15 January 2007 and contains all amendments published in ITU Operational Bulletins up to OB No. 977 of 1 April 2011.

. In order to keep this List up to date, administrations are requested to check the accuracy of the information published therein and to inform TSB of any changes that should be made for its updating.

. For any new assignment of Data Network Identification Codes (DNIC), administrations should fill in the notification form (see last page of this list) and return it to TSB, at the address indicated on the attached form.

. For information, the List is also available on the ITU web page:
