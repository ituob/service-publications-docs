== Note from TSB

. Several requests have been received by ITU, asking that a distinction be made between
the fixed and mobile telephone numbers. A List of access codes/numbers for mobile networks has
been prepared from the information received on the telephone service for publication in the ITU
Operational Bulletin. Administrations/ROAs are requested to verify the information in this List and
to inform ITU about any modifications that they wish to make.

. This List of access codes/numbers for mobile networks replaces that published in ITU
Operational Bulletin No. 993 of 1.XII.2011. Since then, a number of notifications have been
received by TSB and they have been published separately in various issues of the ITU Operational
Bulletin. The present list recapitulates all the different amendments that have been published up to
ITU Operational Bulletin No. 1015 of 1.XI.2012.

. This List will be updated by numbered series of amendments published in the ITU
Operational Bulletin. Furthermore, the information contained in this Annex is also available on the
ITU website: www.itu.int/itu-t/bulletin/annex.html .
