    text: 'Currently the routing for Norfolk Islands is suffering from two types of
      misuse, the codes are being routed away from the island.  Zeatel would like
      to request that carriers send all traffic to only two approved gateways which
      also hold the correct pricing: either to TNZI (Telecom New Zealand International)
      or to Tata Communications. If this is not possible, please contact Zeatel to
      arrange an alternative route to the carriers and to also update their pricing
      to rise to the correct rate for the islands and to remove the island from LCR
      to prevent future disturbance to the island.'
