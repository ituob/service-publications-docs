    text: TSB Circular 87 on Patent apparently involving use of unassigned E.212 Mobile
      Country Code (MCCs) was issued on 2 February 2010.  The patent was filed with
      the World International Property Organization on 6 April 2005, as number PCT/EP2005/003612.

    text: On the basis of contributions from the membership and discussion, ITU-T
      Study Group 2 agreed on 18 November 2010 that the practice described in the
      patent is not consistent with the use of Recommendation E.212 and IMSIs because
      the Recommendation specifies that such resources (MCC) must be duly assigned
      by the ITU-T prior to these being used in any system.  As the patent relies
      on resources marked “spare” in the international identification plan E.212 that
      are likely to be assigned in the future by the ITU-T, such a mechanism must
      not be implemented in a system that refers to Recommendation E.212.

    text: a)          The use of the unassigned international numbering resources
      as proposed in the patent would contravene basic principles of resource management
      and E.212 in particular and whether this would be known to those skilled in
      the art.

    text: b)          The use of numbering resources proposed in the patent is absolutely
      not workable even though 800-899 and 902-999 are reserved or spare now, in particular
      because it would not be practical to make almost 20% of the E.212 code space
      unusable in order to support applications that were developed apparently in
      contravention of ITU-T Recommendations and procedures.

    text: c)           The patent implicitly does not meet requirements for E.212
      international numbering resources for SIMs, for example, the MCC value is preferably
      associated to a kind of a mobile device, and the MNC value is associated to
      one or a family of functionalities of such devices.
