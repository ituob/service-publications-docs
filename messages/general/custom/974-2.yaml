    text: It has come to our attention that certain organizations are offering the
      use of national E.164 numbers and/or shared E.164 network codes for international
      premium rate services. In some cases, it would appear that calls to such numbers
      are “short-stopped” and do not terminate in the country or on the network to
      which the E.164 country code was assigned by the ITU.

    text: 'In this context, please note that 6.2.6 of ITU-T Recommendation E.190 states:
      “E-Series numbering resources will only be utilized by the assignee for the
      specific application for which they have been assigned by the ITU-TSB.” As a
      consequence, national numbering resources should be used only to provide national
      services. Of course any party is free to advertise national numbers internationally,
      and indeed the very purpose of the international numbering scheme is to facilitate
      international calls. However, any call placed to a national number should terminate
      in the country to which the number is assigned (except in the case of mobile
      roaming), because the national numbers were assigned for that purpose. Thus,
      a national number should not be “short-stopped” outside of the country to which
      it has been assigned.'

    text: Similarly, calls placed to shared E.164 network codes should be terminated
      on the network to which the code has been assigned, and should not be “short-stopped”
      outside of that network.

    text: Operating agencies are hereby notified that any use of E.164 codes that
      is not consistent with the purpose for which the codes have been assigned may
      constitute misuse in the sense of Recommendation ITU-T E.156 and may be subject
      to action pursuant to the provisions of that Recommendation.

      of 1000 numbers) has been assigned but it is not yet in use in The Former Yugoslav
      Republic of Macedonia. There is no access to these numbers from The Former Yugoslav
      Republic of Macedonia. However, there have been several reports of use of that
      number range for international calls, possibly associated with fraud. Operators
      of The Former Yugoslav Republic of Macedonia report large number of international
      calls that attempt to terminate in The Former Yugoslav Republic of Macedonia
      to this range; such calls cannot be terminated. It would appear that there is
      some international routing for these calls. The Former Yugoslav Republic of
      Macedonia requests assistance to determine those routes and termination points
      for these calls, which should be stopped since they are based on misuse of numbering
      resources of The Former Yugoslav Republic of Macedonia.”"
