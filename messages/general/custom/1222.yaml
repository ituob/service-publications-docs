  - type: text
    text: ". This recommendation specifies the structure of the visible card number
      (primary account number) and the Issuer Identifier Number (IIN) assignment and
      registration procedure. The Issuer Identifier Number is a part of the visible
      card number with a maximum length of 19 characters. The IIN follows the Major
      Industry Identifier (MII) “89” for telecommunication purpose and then the E.164
      Country Code. The structure is as follows:"

  - type: text
    text: 2 The IIN is used to distinguish among multiple Operating Agencies (OAs)
      who issue cards within a given country; or to distinguish individual countries
      sharing the same country code, or to distinguish both countries and issuers.
      One of the typical uses is to identify an issuer of SIM (Subscriber Identity
      Module) cards.

    text: 3  The assignment of specific Issuer Identifier Numbers should be the responsibility
      of a country. These numbers should only be assigned with the agreement of the
      national Administrations.
