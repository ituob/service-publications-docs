    text: ". A Universal International Freephone Number (UIFN) enables an International
      Freephone Service (IFS) customer to be allocated a unique freephone number(s)
      that is the same throughout the world and all service and call-related charges
      are paid by the IFS customer. One of the typical uses of a UIFN is to reach
      customer services via, for example, a call center for a company’s global customers
      or potential customers."

    text: 2  A UIFN is composed of a three-digit country code for global service application,
      i.e. 800, followed by an 8-digit Global Subscriber Number (GSN), resulting in
      an 11-digit fixed format. (An IFS caller must dial an international prefix prior
      to the UIFN.)

    text: 3  The ITU-TSB has been requested to perform the task of Registrar for UIFNs,
      responsible for processing registration requests and assignment of the GSN portion
      of the UIFN in accordance with Recommendation ITU-T E.169.1 and Recommendation
      ITU-T E.152, "International Freephone Service". At its June 1996 session, ITU
      Council established the UIFN application fee at 200 Swiss francs per UIFN number
      issued (Decision 464, ITU Council, 1996 session).

    text: 4   At its 2017 session, ITU Council decided to continue collecting fees
      for Universal International Freephone Number (UIFN) Registration and to establish
      the registration fee at 300 Swiss francs per number issued, and for non ITU-T
      and ITU-R Sector Members implement an annual maintenance fee at 100 Swiss francs
      per number starting from 1 January 2018 (Decision 600, ITU Council, 2017 session).

    text: 5   The annual fee will be collected based on the status of UIFNs and the
      membership of the primary service providers at 00h00 (Geneva time) of 1 January
      of each year from 2018. The newly reserved UIFNs during the year 2018 and afterwards
      will also be charged an annual maintenance fee for that year. In case of cancellation,
      there will be no refund.
