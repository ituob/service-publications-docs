      claim to have a relation with Thuraya and/or to provide services on the Thuraya
      network using Thuraya numbering resources when this is in fact not the case.
      Such unauthorized claims are apparently made in order to show worldwide services
      that do not exist and/or to misuse Thuraya numbering resources."
