    text: The Premium Number Service project entered by Tel.One and Schrego Communications
      (Austria) also trading as Kwok and HTS (ltaly) or Kimbolten Consultants GmbH
      was terminated in March 2011.  A block of 10 000 numbers ranging from +263 953
      0000 to +263 953 9999 was used to generate traffic.

    text: This means that the continued generation of calls to the block of numbers
      is now treated as fraudulent under cyber crime and TelOne (Pvt) Ltd will not
      be held responsible for such calls.  However, as the block of numbers is the
      property of TelOne (Pvt) Ltd, legal action will be taken against any entity
      that continues to generate or terminate calls carrying the number ranges.
