    text: ". This recommendation specifies the structure of the visible card number
      (primary account number) and the Issuer Identifier Number (IIN) assignment and
      registration procedure. The Issuer Identifier Number is a part of the visible
      card number with a maximum length of 19 characters. The IIN follows the Major
      Industry Identifier (MII) “89” for telecommunication purpose and then the E.164
      Country Code. The structure is as follows:"

    text: 2   The IIN is used to distinguish among multiple Operating Agencies (OAs)
      who issue cards within a given country; or to distinguish individual countries
      sharing the same country code, or to distinguish both countries and issuers.
      One of the typical uses is to identify an issuer of SIM (Subscriber Identity
      Module) cards.

      Recommendation ITU-T E.118, the TSB shall collect a one-time fee for the assignment
      and registration of each new IIN. This fee has been 80 Swiss Francs since 1993
      (ITU Operational Bulletin No. 542 (18.III.1993)).

    text: 4  At its 2017 session, ITU Council decided to continue collecting fees
      for IIN Registration and to establish the registration fee at 150 Swiss francs
      per number issued, and for non ITU-T and ITU-R Sector Members implement an annual
      maintenance fee at 100 Swiss francs per number starting from 1 January 2018
      (Decision 601, ITU Council, 2017 session).

      membership of the assignees at 00h00 (Geneva time) of 1 January of each year
      from 2018. The newly assigned and registered IINs during the year 2018 and afterwards
      will also be charged an annual maintenance fee for that year. In case of cancellation,
      there will be no refund.
