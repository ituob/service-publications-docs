              the timeframe for the implementation of 10-digit fixed line numbers.
              Under this plan, all fixed line telecommunications providers will develop
              their network systems to provide 10-digit fixed line services within
              two years only when the supply of fixed line or mobile numbers is considered
              to be insufficient. In which case, the Office of NBTC will notify of
              the exact time frame for the 10‑digit fixed line numbers implementation
              in advance."
