    text: Several number ranges under non geographic country codes are used for eCall,
      the pan European emergency system for vehicles. These numbers have been assigned
      by the ITU and they have been available for use in association with eCall service.
- type: paragraph

  - type: text
    text: These numbers are used as calling party numbers when the device automatically
      calls the emergency number in the event of an accident. They generally use 15
      digit formats. From 31 March 2018, all new type cars sold in Europe must have
      eCall capability.

    text: In order for the eCall system to operate properly and for the emergency
      services (e.g. call centres and intervention teams) to dial back the phone numbers
      used by the eCall systems, it is crucial that the eCall ranges be opened in
      all networks and that the CLI (Calling Line Identification) for these calls
      is passed between operators in a correct and diallable format according to the
      relevant ITU recommendations.

    text: Given the criticality of the service, we want to alert the assignees and
      all stakeholders on the need for these numbers to be opened and routed on public
      networks and in particular those in Europe.
