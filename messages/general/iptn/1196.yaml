    text: It has been reported to TSB that number ranges under the E.164 country code
      888 are being marketed as premium rate numbers. The E.164 code 888 is currently
      RESERVED and thus any use of numbers under 888 constitutes misuse of international
      numbering resources. We invite concerned entities to take measure to prevent
      such misuse, in particular by not routing or terminating numbers under 888.
