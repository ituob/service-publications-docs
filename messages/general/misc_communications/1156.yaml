    text: This communication is in response to Communication of 29.V.2017 from the
      Republic of Azerbaijan, published in ITU Operational Bulletin No. 1127.

    text: '"Karabakh Telecom" is developing its activities on the ground in accordance
      with the legislation of the Republic of Artsakh (Nagorno Karabakh) with the
      aim to ensure free and unimpeded communication of the people of Nagorno Karabakh
      with the outer world. Armenia considers that the activities of the company don’t
      contradict ITU Constitution and relevant recommendations. The ITU Constitution
      and Convention specifically define the objective of facilitating peaceful relations,
      international cooperation among peoples and economic and social development
      by means of efficient telecommunication services.'

      of Human Rights and the UN Covenants on Human Rights, the realization of the
      individual and collective human rights and fundamental freedoms including economic
      and social rights must not be dependent on the status of the territory where
      peoples live. The UN Covenant on Political and Civil Rights and the UN Covenant
      on Economic, Social and Cultural Rights empower people to pursue their economic,
      social and cultural development by the virtue of the right to self-determination. '

    text: Article 19 of the ICCPR specifically establishes that "everyone shall have
      the right to freedom of expression; this right shall include freedom to seek,
      receive and impart information and ideas of all kinds, regardless of frontiers”

    text: Armenia reiterates its position that the platform of the ITU should not
      be misused in order to promote any conflict perception, with the aim to undermine
      the basic and inalienable human rights of the people of Nagorno Karabakh and
      claim any putative sovereign rights over Nagorno Karabakh, its people and resources.
      The selective reference to the UN Security Council Resolutions by Azerbaijan
      is misleading, since their primary requirement was immediate cessation of all
      hostilities, which was continuously violated by Azerbaijan itself. Furthermore,
      the same resolutions have recognized Nagorno-Karabakh as direct and immediate
      party to the conflict and called for opening of all communications.  The Minsk
      Group Co-Chairmen of the Organization for Security and Cooperation in Europe,
      which have an international mandate of mediating the conflict resolution, have
      recognized the role of the people of Nagorno Karabakh in deciding their future.
      The Minsk Group Co-Chairmen have consistently referred to the equal rights and
      self- determination of peoples as one of the principle of the conflict resolution.

    text: Armenia strongly believes that issues, which belong to the conflict resolution,
      should be addressed within their respective formats and should not be used for
      blame games and thus impede international cooperation. Armenia stands ready
      to facilitate the dialogue between the concerned parties.

    text: Having considered the above communication, I wish to express my serious
      concern about the situation referred to therein and encourage the sides to reach
      a peaceful negotiated settlement of the Nagorno-Karabakh conflict. In this respect
      and like the Secretary-General of the United Nations, I fully support the efforts
      of the OSCE Minsk Group Co-Chairs to help the sides to achieve a peaceful negotiated
      settlement. In this respect and in light of the above communication and the
      communication of 29.V.2017 from the Republic of Azerbaijan I call on the sides
      to address all the issues related to the conflict within OSCE Minsk Group Co-Chairs
      format.
