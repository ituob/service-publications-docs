      the relevant provisions of the United Nations General Assembly resolution 68/262
      of 27 March 2014 “Territorial integrity of Ukraine” calling upon all specialized
      agencies of the United Nations “not to recognize any alteration of the status

    text: Such unilateral actions by the Russian Federation aimed at changing the
      National Numbering Plan of Ukraine in the temporarily occupied part of the territory
      of Ukraine gravely violate international telecommunications law and create significant
      obstacles to the exercising by Ukraine of its sovereign right to regulate its
      telecommunication and to use its numbering resource within internationally recognized
      borders of Ukraine, including Crimea. They have also compromised the integrity
      of international public telecommunication numbering plan as defined by the ITU-T
      Recommendations E.164 (11/2010), E.212 (05/2008) and proper traffic routing
      by public telecommunication networks.

      Recommendations on allocation and management of international numbering resource,

      be used for the identification of calling line and for the provision of international
      telecommunication services within internationally recognized borders of Ukraine,
      including temporarily occupied part of its territory. In this regard, Ukraine
      calls upon all telecommunication operators in their respective countries to
      refrain from routing in the telecommunication public networks of the outgoing
      / incoming international traffic, which can be received in the indices of numbers
      of the numbering plan of the Russian Federation, allocated for the use in the
