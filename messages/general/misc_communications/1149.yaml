    text: ", the management of international series of call signs is a prerogative
      of ITU. Call sign series can be allocated only to the administrations of the
      ITU Member States by world radiocommunication conferences or, between radiocommunication
      conferences, by the ITU Secretary-General. In this respect, the attention of
      the ITU administrations is drawn to the fact that ITU has not allocated call
      sign series Z6 to any of its Member States. Consequently, the utilization of
      call signs series Z6 by any entity without a formal allocation and consent of
      the ITU represents an unauthorized and illegal usage of this international numbering
      resource."
