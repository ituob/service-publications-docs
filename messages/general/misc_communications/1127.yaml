    text: "(“K-Telecom”) company, which has been illegally established in the Nagorno-Karabakh
      region and other occupied territories of Azerbaijan. In particular, the above-mentioned
      company is provided with roaming services using Azerbaijan’s radio frequencies
      without prior legal authorization of the Government of Azerbaijan, and has been
      using the national country code (+374), which is not the Azerbaijan’s national
      country code, in the occupied territories of Azerbaijan for fixed and mobile
      networks."

    text: The Republic of Azerbaijan considers that the above-mentioned on-going illegal
      practices carried out in the occupied territories of Azerbaijan also gravely
      violate the provisions of the ITU Constitution and Convention (Geneva 1992),
      as amended by the Plenipotentiary Conferences (Kyoto 1994, Minneapolis 1998,
      Marrakesh 2002, Antalya 2006, Guadalajara 2010), as well as ITU Recommendation
      E.164 on the international public telecommunication numbering plan.

    text: These actions also create significant obstacles to the implementation by
      Azerbaijan of its exclusive sovereign right to regulate its telecommunications
      and to use its numbering resource within its entire internationally recognized
      territory, to ensure the integrity of its telecommunication infrastructure,
      and to use radio frequencies in its territory in accordance with the provisions
      of the legal instruments of ITU.

    text: In this regards it is necessary to recall that the UN Security Council Resolutions
      822, 853, 874 and 884 of 1993 have reaffirmed sovereignty and territorial integrity
      of Azerbaijan and demanded immediate, complete and unconditional withdrawal
      of the Armenian occupying forces from the Nagorno-Karabakh region and other
      occupied territories of Azerbaijan, and that the UN General Assembly Resolution
      62/243 of 2008 has called on the UN Member States not to recognize as lawful
      the situation resulting from the occupation of the territories of the Republic
      of Azerbaijan, nor render aid or assistance in maintaining this situation. The
      ITU as a specialized Agency of the UN and its Member States have to take the
      above-mentioned UN documents into account.
