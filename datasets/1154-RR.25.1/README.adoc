= OB 1154 RR.25.1 YAML schema

== Purpose

This document describes the YAML schema for the ITU RR.25.1 call sign pattern
data.

== Basic schema

Each YAML file represents the call sign pattern schema of one country. The file
contains information about amateur and experimental station call sign patterns.


== Root keys

There are 3 root keys:

`groups`:: The call sign patterns. There are 2 supported sub-keys: `amateur` and
`experimental`. Each of these items is an array of "group" objects.

`codelists`:: Call sign code lists. Call signs in some countries refer to code
lists to designate regions or usage. The structure is a list of named codelists,
each containing "code" objects.

`notes`:: Optional notes providing additional information about the call sign
patterns. This is an array of strings.


== Group object

A group object represents a collection of call sign patterns for a specific
category, such as amateur or experimental stations.

Each group contains one or more "call sign schema" objects which are patterns
defined by regex and/or criteria objects.

Groups are organized under the root key `groups` with specific sub-keys for
different station types.

The `groups` key contains the following sub-keys:

* `amateur`: Call sign patterns for amateur stations
* `experimental`: Call sign patterns for experimental stations

[example]
====
[source,yaml]
----
groups:
  amateur:
    - name: Class 1 licence
      regex: V31[:upper:]{2}
    - name: Class 2 licence
      regex: V32[:upper:]{2}
  experimental:
    - name: Experimental licence
      regex: V31[:upper:]{2}
----

== Call sign schema objects

=== General

A call sign schema object can have the following properties:

`name`:: Name or description of the schema. This is optional.

`regex`:: The regular expression (regex) that expresses the call sign pattern.

`criteria`:: The criteria of the schema, used for complex patterns that cannot
be fully expressed in a single regex.

=== Simple schema (regex only)

The simple form of a call sign schema is defined using a regular expression.

[example]
====
[source,yaml]
----
name: Class 2 licence
regex: V32[:upper:]{2}
----
====

There are special regex group operators that can be used:

* `[:digit:]`: Matches digits (0-9)
* `[:upper:]`: Matches uppercase letters (A-Z)
* `[:name:]`: References a defined codelist (e.g., `[:amateur_area:]`)

=== Complex schema (with criteria)

For more complex patterns, the `criteria` property is used to define the
pattern in a structured way.

The `criteria` property is an array of "segment" objects, each defining a part
of the call sign pattern.


[example]
====
[source,yaml]
----
name: Advanced license
regex: (VK|AX|VI)[:amateur_area:][A-GI-KS-UW-Z][A-Z]{2,3}
criteria:
- segment_type: enum
  key: "1"
  values:
    - segment_type: string
      value: VK
    - segment_type: string
      value: AX
    - segment_type: string
      value: VI
- segment_type: codelist
  key: "2"
  codelist: amateur_area
- segment_type: enum
  key: "3"
  values:
    - segment_type: range
      range:
        from: A
        to: G
    - segment_type: range
      range:
        from: I
        to: K
    - segment_type: range
      range:
        from: S
        to: U
    - segment_type: range
      range:
        from: W
        to: Z
- segment_type: range
  key: "4"
  range:
    from: A
    to: Z
    cardinality: "2-3"
----
====


== Segment object

=== General

A segment object defines a specific part of a call sign pattern. There are four
types of segments, each with different encoding:

* `string`: A fixed string value
* `range`: A range of characters with specified cardinality
* `codelist`: A reference to a predefined code list
* `enum`: An array of other segment types

Segments are used within criteria objects to define complex call sign patterns
that cannot be expressed with a simple regex.

=== String segment

A string segment represents a fixed string value in a call sign. It requires the
`segment_type: string`, `key`, and `value` properties.

[example]
====
In this example, the first part of the call sign must be exactly "C6".

[source,yaml]
----
segment_type: string
key: "1"
value: C6
----
====


=== Range segment

A range segment represents a range of characters with specified cardinality. It
requires `segment_type: range`, `key`, and `range` properties.

The `range` property includes one of `from` and `cardinality`, where `to` is
optional.

[example]
====
[source,yaml]
----
segment_type: range
key: "2"
range:
  from: "2"
  to: "9"
----

This defines a single digit in the range 2-9.

[source,yaml]
----
segment_type: range
key: "3"
range:
  from: A
  to: Z
  cardinality: "2-3"
----

This defines 2-3 uppercase letters (A-Z).
====

The `cardinality` property can be a single value (e.g., "2") or a range (e.g.,
"2-3").

=== Codelist segment

A codelist segment references a predefined code list. It requires
`segment_type: codelist`, `key`, and `codelist` properties.

[example]
====
[source,yaml]
----
segment_type: codelist
key: "2"
codelist: amateur_area
----

This references the codelist named "amateur_area", which must be defined in the
`codelists` section of the file:

[source,yaml]
----
codelists:
  - name: amateur_area
    list:
    - code: "1"
      name: Australian Capital Territory
    - code: "2"
      name: New South Wales
    # ...
----
====

=== Enum segment

An enum segment represents a choice between multiple options. It requires
`segment_type: enum`, `key`, and `values` properties. Each value in the
`values` array is itself a segment.

[example]
====
[source,yaml]
----
segment_type: enum
key: "1"
values:
  - segment_type: string
    value: VK
  - segment_type: string
    value: AX
  - segment_type: string
    value: VI
----

This means the first part of the call sign can be either "VK", "AX", or "VI".
====

Enum segments can contain any other segment type, including nested enums.

== Code list object

=== General

A code list object defines a list of codes and their corresponding names.

Codelists are referenced by codelist segments.

It contains the following properties:

`name`:: The name of the code list.
`list`:: An array of code objects.

Each code object contains the following properties:

`code`:: The code value.
`name`:: The name or description of the code.

[example]
====
[source,yaml]
----
codelists:
  - name: amateur_area
    list:
    - code: "1"
      name: Australian Capital Territory
    - code: "2"
      name: New South Wales
    # ...
----
====

=== Code object

A code object represents an entry in a codelist, with a code value and its
corresponding name or meaning.

A code object has the following properties:

`code`:: The code value, which can be a string or a range.
`name`:: The name or description of the code.

There are 2 types of code objects:

* `code` as string: The code value (string).
* `code` as range: The code value (range), which accepts a `from` and `to`
  property.

.Code object with string value
[example]
====
[source,yaml]
----
- code: "1"
  name: Australian Capital Territory
- code: "2"
  name: New South Wales
----
====

.Code object with range value
[example]
====
[source,yaml]
----
- code: "1-5"
  name: Range of codes
----
====



== Examples of complete call sign pattern definitions

=== Simple pattern with string and range segments

This example from Bahamas shows a simple pattern using string and range
segments:

[example]
====
[source,yaml]
----
groups:
  amateur:
  - regex: C6[2-9][:upper:]{2}
    criteria:
    - segment_type: string
      key: "1"
      value: C6
    - key: "2"
      segment_type: range
      range:
        from: "2"
        to: "9"
    - key: "3"
      segment_type: range
      range:
        from: A
        to: Z
        cardinality: "2"
----
====

This defines amateur station call signs starting with "C6", followed by a
digit between 2 and 9, and ending with 2 uppercase letters.

Notice that the `criteria` property fully describes all requirements of the
regex property, and hence only one of them is needed for implementation.

=== Pattern with codelist segment

This example from Austria shows a pattern using a codelist segment.

[example]
====
[source,yaml]
----
groups:
  amateur:
  - regex: OE[:amateur_area:][:upper:]{2,3}
    criteria:
    - segment_type: string
      key: "1"
      value: OE
    - key: "2"
      segment_type: codelist
      codelist: amateur_area
    - key: "3"
      segment_type: range
      range:
        from: A
        to: Z
        cardinality: "2-3"

codelists:
  - name: amateur_area
    list:
    - code: "1"
      name: Vienna (amateur stations only)
    - code: "2"
      name: Salzburg
    # ...
----
====

This defines amateur station call signs starting with "OE", followed by a digit
representing an area code from the "amateur_area" codelist, and ending with 2-3
uppercase letters.

=== Complex pattern with enum segments

This example from Australia shows a complex pattern using enum segments:

[example]
====
[source,yaml]
----
groups:
  amateur:
    - name: Advanced license
      regex: (VK|AX|VI)[:amateur_area:][A-GI-KS-UW-Z][A-Z]{2,3}
      criteria:
      - segment_type: enum
        key: "1"
        values:
          - segment_type: string
            value: VK
          - segment_type: string
            value: AX
          - segment_type: string
            value: VI
      - segment_type: codelist
        key: "2"
        codelist: amateur_area
      - segment_type: enum
        key: "3"
        values:
          - segment_type: range
            range:
              from: A
              to: G
          - segment_type: range
            range:
              from: I
              to: K
          - segment_type: range
            range:
              from: S
              to: U
          - segment_type: range
            range:
              from: W
              to: Z
      - segment_type: range
        key: "4"
        range:
          from: A
          to: Z
          cardinality: "2-3"
----
====

This defines advanced license amateur station call signs with a complex
structure using both enum segments for multiple options and range segments with
specific cardinality.

=== Using YAML anchors for shared patterns

This example from Bahamas shows how YAML anchors can be used to share patterns
between amateur and experimental stations if they are identical.

[example]
====
[source,yaml]
----
groups:
  amateur: &general
  - regex: C6[2-9][:upper:]{2}
    criteria:
    - segment_type: string
      key: "1"
      value: C6
    - key: "2"
      segment_type: range
      range:
        from: "2"
        to: "9"
    - key: "3"
      segment_type: range
      range:
        from: A
        to: Z
        cardinality: "2"
